This is a small demonstration of a console built with the
[JGrapes component frameworks](https://mnlipp.github.io/jgrapes/).

Conlets are rendered in preview mode on the overview tab. Most
conlets also support rendering in view mode. Using the latter
mode, they are rendered in a tab of their own, i.e. they have
the full page available to display their information. What you
currently see is an instance of the markdown conlet rendered
in view mode.

You can use the icon on the top right corner of the console
to add more conlets to the overview tab.

Technical details about the console can be found on the project's
[home page](https://mnlipp.github.io/jgrapes/WebConsole.html).
